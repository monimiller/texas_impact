title: Human Rights
description: Human rights are rights we have merely because we exist as human beings. They are inherent to all people, regardless of nationality, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other status. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the United Nations General Assembly adopted in 1948, establishes a modern framework for linking public policy and law to the theological and moral tenets shared across the worldâ€™s faith traditions.
